This **Flutter Weather App** provides users with real-time weather information and a 3-day forecast for any city. The app features a modern, user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily check weather updates and plan their day effectively.

## Features

- **3-Day Weather Forecast**: A visually appealing horizontal scrollable section for future weather predictions.
- **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly error messages for invalid city names.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices with different screen sizes.
- **Nginx Deployment**: Built for Flutter Web and can be deployed using Nginx for optimal performance.

## Assets
We used weather-related assets (icons and images) from the repository:

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter**: For building the app's cross-platform UI.
- **OpenWeather API**: To fetch real-time weather data.
- **Dart**: For programming the app's functionality.
- **Docker**: To containerize the app and make it ready for deployment.
